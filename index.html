	<h2>Data Cleaning</h2>
	<p>When cleaning the data, there were numerous errors which were found and cleaned. These can be divided into a number of categories and subcategories. OpenRefine was used for the data cleaning with occasional viewings in Excel. The list below shows the type of errors, the columns affected (where applicable) and the solution.</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Date Validation</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Start Date</li>
		<li>Completion Date</li>
		<li>Planned Completion Date</li>
		<li>Actual Completion Date</li>
		<li>Combined Updated time</li>
	</ul>
	<b>Solution:</b> Each of these dates was selected and a common transform was applied, changing them to a date data type. Combined Updated Time was created from Updated Time and Date to form exact time + date.
	<li>Multiple Representations</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Agency Name</li>
			<li>Agency ID</li>
			<li>Project Description</li>
		</ul>
	<b>Solution:</b> For each of these, a text-facet was applied and the data was grouped together. Different algorithms were checked to test similarity and then converted to the most common name.
	<li>Summation Records</li>
	<b>Solution:</b>Each row called 'Total' was starred and removed.
	<li>Duplicate Records</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Duplicate Project ID records</li>
	</ul>
	<b>Solution:</b> ProjectID was the column with a uniqe identifier. After performing a text facet, rows with the same were looked at and duplicate records deleted.
	<li>Mixed use of Numerical scales</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Lifecycle Cost</li>
	</ul>
	<b>Solution:</b> This was one of the more challenging errors to fix. This value was compared to the Projected Cost and Actual cost and brought as close to them as posisble if it seemed too much. For example, if Project and Actual cost was 5, and the lifecycle cost was 5000,it was assumed that an error is present. Similarly, if the projected cost is 5654 and actual cost is 256454, then it was assumed that 2 was added by an accident. A few more were more ambigious and the best judgement was used.
	<li>Unorganised Data</li>
	<li>Spellling Errors</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Agency</li>
		<li>Project Description</li>
	</ul>
